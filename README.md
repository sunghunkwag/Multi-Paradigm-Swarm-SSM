# chaos-prediction-envs

> **Experimental repository.** This codebase is a research prototype and is not intended for production use. APIs, structure, and behavior may change without notice.

A flat-structured experimental testbed combining multi-agent swarm architectures (JEPA, Symbolic, Mamba SSM, Liquid CfC, SNN LIF) with chaotic dynamical system benchmarks (1D Lorenz, high-dimensional chaos, adversarial, sequential prediction). Includes a meta-kernel with NAS-based self-modification and MAML-based online adaptation. All modules reside in the repository root. See `main.py` for the unified benchmark entry point and `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
