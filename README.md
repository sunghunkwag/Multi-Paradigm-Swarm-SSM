# chaos-prediction-envs

> **Experimental sandbox.** This repository is a throwaway-style research testbed for chaos prediction and multi-agent swarms. It is not stable, not cleaned up for reuse, and explicitly not intended for production.

The code provides a flat-structured playground for combining heterogeneous agents (JEPA, Symbolic, Mamba SSM, Liquid CfC, SNN LIF) with chaotic dynamical system benchmarks (1D Lorenz, high-dimensional chaos, adversarial, sequential prediction). All modules live in the repository root, imports may change without notice, and breaking changes are expected. Use `main.py` only for ad-hoc experiments after installing the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
