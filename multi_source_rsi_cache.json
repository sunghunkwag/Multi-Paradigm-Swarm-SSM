It is based on [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) with *major* config overhaul, comes with a Monokai color scheme, amazing [clink](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/) (further enhanced by [clink-completions](https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions)) and a custom prompt layout.  ![Cmder Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/g1nNf0I.png)  ## Why use it  The main advantage of Cmder is portability. It is designed to be totally self-contained with no external dependencies, which makes it great for **USB Sticks** or **cloud storage**. So you can carry your console, aliases and binaries (like wget, curl and git) with you anywhere.  The Cmder's user interface is also designed to be more eye pleasing, and you can compare the main differences between Cmder and ConEmu [here](https://conemu.github.io/en/cmder.html).  ## Installation ### Single User Portable Config  1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/) 2. Extract the archive. *Note: This path should not be `C:\\Program Files` or anywhere else that would require Administrator access for modifying configuration files* 3. (optional) Place your own executable files into the `%cmder_root%\\bin` folder to be injected into your PATH. 4. Run `Cmder.exe`  ### Shared Cmder install with Non-Portable Individual User Config 1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/) 2. Extract the archive to a shared location. 3. (optional) Place your own executable files and custom app folders into the `%cmder_root%\\bin`. See: [bin/README.md](./bin/Readme.md)    - This folder to be injected into your PATH by default.    - See `/max_depth [1-5]` in 'Command Line Arguments for `init.bat`' table to add subdirectories recursively. 4. (optional) Place your own custom app folders into the `%cmder_root%\\opt`. See: [opt/README.md](./opt/Readme.md)    - This folder will NOT be injected into your PATH so you have total control of what gets added. 5. Run `Cmder.exe` with `/C` command line argument. Example: `cmder.exe /C %userprofile%\\cmder_config`    * This will create the following directory structure if it is missing.       ```      c:\\users\\[CH JaDi Rajput]\\cmder_config      \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500bin      \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500config      \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500profile.d      \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500opt      ```    - (optional) Place your own executable files and custom app folders into `%userprofile%\\cmder_config\\bin`.     - This folder to be injected into your PATH by default.     - See `/max_depth [1-5]` in 'Command Line Arguments for `init.bat`' table to add subdirectories recursively.   - (optional) Place your own custom app folders into the `%user_profile%\\cmder_config\\opt`.     - This folder will NOT be injected into your PATH so you have total control of what gets added.   * Both the shared install and the individual user config locations can contain a full set of init and profile.d scripts enabling shared config with user overrides.  See below.  ## Cmder.exe Command Line Arguments   | Argument                  | Description                                                                              | | -------------------       | -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  | | `/C [user_root_path]`     | Individual user Cmder root folder.  Example: `%userprofile%\\cmder_config`                | | `/M`                      | Use `conemu-%computername%.xml` for ConEmu settings storage instead of `user_conemu.xml` | | `/REGISTER [ALL, USER]`   | Register a Windows Shell Menu shortcut.                                                  | | `/UNREGISTER [ALL, USER]` | Un-register a Windows Shell Menu shortcut.                                               | | `/SINGLE`                 | Start Cmder in single mode.                                                              | | `/START [start_path]`     | Folder path to start in.                                                                 | | `/TASK [task_name]`       | Task to start after launch.                                                              | | `/X [ConEmu extras pars]` | Forwards parameters to ConEmu                                                             |  ## Context Menu Integration  So you've experimented with Cmder a little and want to give it a shot in a more permanent home;  ### Shortcut to open Cmder in a chosen folder  1. Open a terminal as an Administrator 2. Navigate to the directory you have placed Cmder 3. Execute `.\\cmder.exe /REGISTER ALL`    _If you get a message \"Access Denied\" ensure you are executing the command in an **Administrator** prompt._  In a file explorer window right click in or on a directory to see \"Cmder Here\" in the context menu.  ## Keyboard shortcuts  ### Tab manipulation  * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> : New tab dialog (maybe you want to open cmd as admin?) * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> : Close tab * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> : Close tab (if pressed on empty command) * <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>#Number</kbd> : Fast new tab: <kbd>1</kbd> - CMD, <kbd>2</kbd> - PowerShell * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> : Switch to next tab * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> : Switch to previous tab * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>#Number</kbd> : Switch to tab #Number * <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Fullscreen  ### Shell  * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> : Traverse up in directory structure (lovely feature!) * <kbd>End</kbd>, <kbd>Home</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> : Traversing text with as usual on Windows * <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> : History search * <kbd>Shift</kbd> + Mouse : Select and copy text from buffer  _(Some shortcuts are not yet documented, though they exist - please document them here)_  ## Features  ### Access to multiple shells in one window using tabs You can open multiple tabs each containing one of the following shells:  | Task                | Shell            | Description                                                                                                  | | ----                | -----            | -----------                                                                                                  | | Cmder               | `cmd.exe`        | Windows `cmd.exe` shell enhanced with Git, Git aware prompt, Clink (GNU Readline), and Aliases.              | | Cmder as Admin      | `cmd.exe`        | Administrative Windows `cmd.exe` Cmder shell.                                                                | | PowerShell          | `powershell.exe` | Windows PowerShell enhanced with Git and Git aware prompt .                                                  | | PowerShell as Admin | `powershell.exe` | Administrative Windows `powershell.exe` Cmder shell.                                                         | | Bash                | `bash.exe`       | Unix/Linux like bash shell running on Windows.                                                               | | Bash as Admin       | `bash.exe`       | Administrative Unix/Linux like bash shell running on Windows.                                                | | Mintty              | `bash.exe`       | Unix/Linux like bash shell running on Windows. See below for Mintty configuration differences                | | Mintty as Admin     | `bash.exe`       | Administrative Unix/Linux like bash shell running on Windows. See below for Mintty configuration differences |  Cmder, PowerShell, and Bash tabs all run on top of the Windows Console API and work as you might expect in Cmder with access to use ConEmu's color schemes, key bindings and other settings defined in the ConEmu Settings dialog.  \u26a0 *NOTE:* Only the full edition of Cmder comes with a pre-installed bash, using a vendored [git-for-windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) installation. The pre-configured Bash tabs may not work on Cmder mini edition without additional configuration.  You may however, choose to use an external installation of bash, such as Microsoft's [Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (called WSL) or the [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) project which provides POSIX support on windows.  \u26a0 *NOTE:* Mintty tabs use a program called 'mintty' as the terminal emulator that is not based on the Windows Console API, rather it's rendered graphically by ConEmu. Mintty differs from the other tabs in that it supports xterm/xterm-256color TERM types, and does not work with ConEmu settings like color schemes and key bindings.  As such, some differences in functionality are to be expected, such as Cmder not being able to apply a system-wide configuration to it.  As a result mintty specific config is done via the `[%USERPROFILE%|$HOME]/.minttyrc` file.  You may read more about Mintty and its config file [here](https://github.com/mintty/mintty).  An example of setting Cmder portable terminal colors for mintty:  From a bash/mintty shell:  ``` cd $CMDER_ROOT/vendor git clone https://github.com/karlin/mintty-colors-solarized.git cd mintty-colors-solarized/ echo source \\$CMDER_ROOT/vendor/mintty-colors-solarized/mintty-solarized-dark.sh>>$CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh ```  You may find some Monokai color schemes for mintty to match Cmder [here](https://github.com/oumu/mintty-color-schemes/blob/master/base16-monokai-mod.minttyrc).  ### Changing Cmder Default `cmd.exe` Prompt Config File  The default Cmder shell `cmd::Cmder` prompt is customized using `Clink` and is configured by editing a config file that exists in one of two locations:  - Single User Portable Config `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\cmder_prompt_config.lua` - Shared Cmder install with Non-Portable Individual User Config `%CMDER_USER_CONFIG%\\cmder_prompt_config.lua`  If your Cmder setup does not have this file create it from `%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\cmder_prompt_config.lua.default`  Customizations include:  - Colors. - Single/Multi-line. - Full path/Folder only. - `[user]@[host]` to the beginning of the prompt. - `~` for home directory. - `\u03bb` symbol  Documentation is in the file for each setting.  ### Changing Cmder Default `cmd.exe` Shell Startup Behaviour Using Task Arguments  1. Press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> 1. Click either:   * `1. {cmd::Cmder as Admin}`   * `2. {cmd::Cmder}` 1. Add command line arguments where specified below:    *Note: Pay attention to the quotes!*    ```   cmd /s /k \"\"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\init.bat\" [ADD ARGS HERE]\"   ```  ##### Command Line Arguments for `init.bat`  | Argument                        | Description                                                                                                                                        | Default                                | | -----------------------------   | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     | -------------------------------------  | | `/c [user cmder root]`          | Enables user bin and config folders for 'Cmder as admin' sessions due to non-shared environment.                                                   | not set                                | | `/d`                            | Enables debug output.                                                                                                                              | not set                                | | `/f`                            | Enables Cmder Fast Init Mode.

Edit the below files to add your own configuration:  | Shell         | Cmder Portable User Config                | | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | | Cmder         | `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\user_profile.cmd`    | | PowerShell    | `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\\config\\user_profile.ps1` | | Bash/Mintty   | `$CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh`      |  Note: Bash and Mintty sessions will also source the `$HOME/.bashrc` file if it exists after it sources `$CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh`.  You can write `*.cmd|*.bat`, `*.ps1`, and `*.sh` scripts and just drop them in the `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\profile.d` folder to add startup config to Cmder.  | Shell         | Cmder `Profile.d` Scripts                          | | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | | Cmder         | `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\profile.d\\*.bat and *.cmd`    | | PowerShell    | `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\\config\\profile.d\\*.ps1`           | | Bash/Mintty   | `$CMDER_ROOT/config/profile.d/*.sh`                |  #### Git Status Opt-Out   To disable Cmder prompt git status globally add the following to `~/.gitconfig` or locally for a single repo `[repo]/.git/config` and start a new session.   *Note: This configuration is not portable*   ```  [cmder]    status = false      # Opt out of Git status for 'ALL' Cmder supported shells.    cmdstatus = false   # Opt out of Git status for 'Cmd.exe' shells.    psstatus = false    # Opt out of Git status for 'Powershell.exe and 'Pwsh.exe' shells.    shstatus = false    # Opt out of Git status for 'bash.exe' shells.  ```  ### Aliases #### Cmder(`Cmd.exe`) Aliases You can define simple aliases for `cmd.exe` sessions with a command like `alias name=command`.  Cmd.exe aliases support optional parameters through the `$1-9` or the `$*` special characters so the alias `vi=vim.exe $*` typed as `vi [filename]` will open `[filename]` in `vim.exe`.  Cmd.exe aliases can also be more complex. See: [DOSKEY.EXE documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/doskey) for additional details on complex aliases/macros for `cmd.exe`  Aliases defined using the `alias.bat` command will automatically be saved in the `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\user_aliases.cmd` file  To make an alias and/or any other profile settings permanent add it to one of the following:  Note: These are loaded in this order by `$CMDER_ROOT/vendor/init.bat`.  Anything stored in `%CMDER_ROOT%` will be a portable setting and will follow cmder to another machine.  * `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\profile.d\\*.cmd` and `\\*.bat` * `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\user_aliases.cmd` * `%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\user_profile.cmd`  #### Bash.exe|Mintty.exe Aliases Bash shells support simple and complex aliases with optional parameters natively so they work a little different.  Typing `alias name=command` will create an alias only for the current running session.  To make an alias and/or any other profile settings permanent add it to one of the following:  Note: These are loaded in this order by `$CMDER_ROOT/vendor/git-for-windows/etc/profile.d/cmder.sh`.  Anything stored in `$CMDER_ROOT` will be a portable setting and will follow cmder to another machine.  * `$CMDER_ROOT/config/profile.d/*.sh` * `$CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh` * `$HOME/.bashrc`  If you add bash aliases to `$CMDER_ROOT/config/user_profile.sh` they will be portable and follow your Cmder folder if you copy it to another machine.  `$HOME/.bashrc` defined aliases are not portable.  #### PowerShell.exe Aliases PowerShell has native simple alias support, for example `[new-alias | set-alias] alias command`, so complex aliases with optional parameters are not supported in PowerShell sessions.  Type `get-help [new-alias|set-alias] -full` for help on PowerShell aliases.  To make an alias and/or any other profile settings permanent add it to one of the following:  Note: These are loaded in this order by `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\\vendor\\user_profile.ps1`.  Anything stored in `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT` will be a portable setting and will follow cmder to another machine.  * `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\\config\\profile.d\\*.ps1` * `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\\config\\user_profile.ps1`  ### SSH Agent  To start the vendored SSH agent simply call `start-ssh-agent`, which is in the `vendor/git-for-windows/cmd` folder.  If you want to run SSH agent on startup, include the line `@call \"%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%/cmd/start-ssh-agent.cmd\"` in `%CMDER_ROOT%/config/user_profile.cmd` (usually just uncomment it).  ### Vendored Git  Cmder is by default shipped with a vendored Git installation.  On each instance of launching Cmder, an attempt is made to locate any other user provided Git binaries. Upon finding a `git.exe` binary, Cmder further compares its version against the vendored one _by executing_ it. The vendored `git.exe` binary is _only_ used when it is more recent than the user-installed one.  You may use your favorite version of Git by including its path in the `%PATH%` environment variable.  Moreover, the **Mini** edition of Cmder (found on the [downloads page](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases)) excludes any vendored Git binaries.  ### Using external Cygwin/Babun, MSys2, WSL, or Git for Windows SDK with Cmder.  You may run bash (the default shell used on Linux, macOS and GNU/Hurd) externally on Cmder, using the following instructions:  1. Setup a new task by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> +<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>. 1. Click the `+` button to add a task. 1. Name the new task in the top text box. 1. Provide task parameters, this is optional. 1. Add `cmd /c \"[path_to_external_env]\\bin\\bash --login -i\" -new_console` to the `Commands` text box.  **Recommended Optional Steps:**  Copy the `vendor/cmder_exinit` file to the Cygwin/Babun, MSys2, or Git for Windows SDK environments `/etc/profile.d/` folder to use portable settings in the `$CMDER_ROOT/config` folder.  Note: MinGW could work if the init scripts include `profile.d` but this has not been tested.  The destination file extension depends on the shell you use in that environment.  For example:  * bash - Copy to `/etc/profile.d/cmder_exinit.sh` * zsh  - Copy to `/etc/profile.d/cmder_exinit.zsh`  Uncomment and edit the below line in the script to use Cmder config even when launched from outside Cmder.  ``` # CMDER_ROOT=${USERPROFILE}/cmder  # This is not required if launched from Cmder. ```  ### Customizing user sessions using `init.bat` custom arguments.  You can pass custom arguments to `init.bat` and use `cexec.cmd` in your `user_profile.cmd` to evaluate these arguments then execute commands based on a particular flag being detected or not.  `init.bat` creates two shortcuts for using `cexec.cmd` in your profile scripts.  #### `%ccall%` - Evaluates flags, runs commands if found,  and returns to the calling script and continues.  ``` ccall=call C:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev\\vendor\\bin\\cexec.cmd ```  Example: `%ccall% /startnotepad start notepad.exe`  #### `%cexec%` - Evaluates flags, runs commands if found, and does not return to the calling script.  ``` cexec=C:\\Users\\user\\cmderdev\\vendor\\bin\\cexec.cmd ```  Example: `%cexec% /startnotepad start notepad.exe`  It is useful when you have multiple tasks to execute `cmder` and need it to initialize the session differently depending on the task chosen.  To conditionally start `notepad.exe` when you start a specific `cmder` task:  * Press <kbd>win</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd> * Click `+` to add a new task. * Add the below to the `Commands` block:    ```batch    cmd.exe /k \"\"%ConEmuDir%\\..\\init.bat\" /startnotepad\"    ```  * Add the below to your `%cmder_root%\\config\\user_profile.cmd`    ```batch    %ccall% \"/startNotepad\" \"start\" \"notepad.exe\"`    ```  To see detailed usage of `cexec`, type `cexec /?` in cmder.  ### Integrating Cmder with [Hyper](https://github.com/zeit/hyper), [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and your favorite IDEs  Cmder by default comes with a vendored ConEmu installation as the underlying terminal emulator, as stated [here](https://conemu.github.io/en/cmder.html).  However, Cmder can in fact run in a variety of other terminal emulators, and even integrated IDEs. Assuming you have the latest version of Cmder, follow the following instructions to get Cmder working with your own terminal emulator.  For instructions on how to integrate Cmder with your IDE, please read our [Wiki section](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki#cmder-integration).  ## Upgrading  The process of upgrading Cmder depends on the version/build you are currently running.  If you have a `[cmder_root]/config/user[-|_]conemu.xml`, you are running a newer version of Cmder, follow the below process:  1. Exit all Cmder sessions and relaunch `[cmder_root]/cmder.exe`, this backs up your existing `[cmder_root]/vendor/conemu-maximus5/conemu.xml` to `[cmder_root]/config/user[-|_]conemu.xml`.     * The `[cmder_root]/config/user[-|_]conemu.xml` contains any custom settings you have made using the 'Setup Tasks' settings dialog.  2. Exit all Cmder sessions and backup any files you have manually edited under `[cmder_root]/vendor`.     * Editing files under `[cmder_root]/vendor` is not recommended since you will need to re-apply these changes after any upgrade.  All user customizations should go in `[cmder_root]/config` folder.  3.  Delete the `[cmder_root]/vendor` folder. 4.  Extract the new `cmder.zip` or `cmder_mini.zip` into `[cmder_root]/` overwriting all files when prompted.  If you do not have a `[cmder_root]/config/user[-|_]conemu.xml`, you are running an older version of cmder, follow the below process:  1. Exit all Cmder sessions and backup `[cmder_root]/vendor/conemu-maximus5/conemu.xml` to `[cmder_root]/config/user[-|_]conemu.xml`.  2. Backup any files you have manually edited under `[cmder_root]/vendor`.     * Editing files under `[cmder_root]/vendor` is not recommended since you will need to re-apply these changes after any upgrade.  All user customizations should go in `[cmder_root]/config` folder.  3.  Delete the `[cmder_root]/vendor` folder. 4.  Extract the new `cmder.zip` or `cmder_mini.zip` into `[cmder_root]/` overwriting all files when prompted.  ## Current development builds  You can download builds of the current development branch by going to AppVeyor via the following link:  [![AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/cmderdev/cmder?svg=True)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MartiUK/cmder/branch/master/artifacts)  ## License  All software included is bundled with own license  The MIT License (MIT)  Copyright (c) 2016 Samuel Vasko  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Contacts  If you would like to ask a question, you can write to my telegram or to the github (or both). To contact me via telegram, you should use import_card method with argument 000653bf:0738ca5d:5521fbac:29246815:a27d0cda  Usage  bin/telegram-cli -k <public-server-key> By default, the public key is stored in tg-server.pub in the same folder or in /etc/telegram-cli/server.pub. If not, specify where to find it:  bin/telegram-cli -k tg-server.pub Client support TAB completion and command history.  Peer refers to the name of the contact or dialog and can be accessed by TAB completion. For user contacts peer name is Name Lastname with all spaces changed to underscores. For chats it is it's title with all spaces changed to underscores For encrypted chats it is <Ex\u0441lamation mark> Name Lastname with all spaces changed to underscores.  If two or more peers have same name, number is appended to the name. (for example A_B, A_B#1, A_B#2 and so on)  Supported commands  Messaging  msg <peer> Text - sends message to this peer fwd <user> <msg-seqno> - forward message to user. You can see message numbers starting client with -N chat_with_peer <peer> starts one on one chat session with this peer. /exit or /quit to end this mode. add_contact <phone-number> <first-name> <last-name> - tries to add contact to contact-list by phone rename_contact <user> <first-name> <last-name> - tries to rename contact. If you have another device it will be a fight mark_read <peer> - mark read all received messages with peer delete_msg <msg-seqno> - deletes message (not completly, though) restore_msg <msg-seqno> - restores delete message. Impossible for secret chats. Only possible short time (one hour, I think) after deletion Multimedia  send_photo <peer> <photo-file-name> - sends photo to peer send_video <peer> <video-file-name> - sends video to peer send_text <peer> <text-file-name> - sends text file as plain messages load_photo/load_video/load_video_thumb/load_audio/load_document/load_document_thumb <msg-seqno> - loads photo/video/audio/document to download dir view_photo/view_video/view_video_thumb/view_audio/view_document/view_document_thumb <msg-seqno> - loads photo/video to download dir and starts system default viewer fwd_media <msg-seqno> send media in your message. Use this to prevent sharing info about author of media (though, it is possible to determine user_id from media itself, it is not possible get access_hash of this user) set_profile_photo <photo-file-name> - sets userpic. Photo should be square, or server will cut biggest central square part Group chat options  chat_info <chat> - prints info about chat chat_add_user <chat> <user> - add user to chat chat_del_user <chat> <user> - remove user from chat rename_chat <chat> <new-name> create_group_chat <chat topic> <user1> <user2> <user3> ... - creates a groupchat with users, use chat_add_user to add more users chat_set_photo <chat> <photo-file-name> - sets group chat photo. Same limits as for profile photos. Search  search <peer> pattern - searches pattern in messages with peer global_search pattern - searches pattern in all messages Secret chat  create_secret_chat <user> - creates secret chat with this user visualize_key <secret_chat> - prints visualization of encryption key. You should compare it to your partner's one set_ttl <secret_chat> <ttl> - sets ttl to secret chat. Though client does ignore it, client on other end can make use of it accept_secret_chat <secret_chat> - manually accept secret chat (only useful when starting with -E key) Stats and various info  user_info <user> - prints info about user history <peer> [limit] - prints history (and marks it as read). Default limit = 40 dialog_list - prints info about your dialogs contact_list - prints info about users in your contact list suggested_contacts - print info about contacts, you have max common friends stats - just for debugging show_license - prints contents of GPLv2 help - prints this help get_self - get our user info Card  export_card - print your 'card' that anyone can later use to import your contact import_card <card> - gets user by card. You can write messages to him after that.

Pearce <spearce@spearce.org> # Conceptually based on gitcompletion (http://gitweb.hawaga.org.uk/). # Distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 2.0. # # The contained completion routines provide support for completing: # #    *) local and remote branch names #    *) local and remote tag names #    *) .git/remotes file names #    *) git 'subcommands' #    *) tree paths within 'ref:path/to/file' expressions #    *) common --long-options # # To use these routines: # #    1) Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. ~/.git-completion.sh). #    2) Added the following line to your .bashrc: #        source ~/.git-completion.sh # #    3) Consider changing your PS1 to also show the current branch: #        PS1='[\\u@\\h \\W$(__git_ps1 \" (%s)\")]\\$ ' # #       The argument to __git_ps1 will be displayed only if you #       are currently in a git repository.  The %s token will be #       the name of the current branch. # #       In addition, if you set GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE to a nonempty #       value, unstaged (*) and staged (+) changes will be shown next #       to the branch name.  You can configure this per-repository #       with the bash.showDirtyState variable, which defaults to true #       once GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE is enabled. # #       You can also see if currently something is stashed, by setting #       GIT_PS1_SHOWSTASHSTATE to a nonempty value. If something is stashed, #       then a '$' will be shown next to the branch name. # #       If you would like to see if there're untracked files, then you can #       set GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES to a nonempty value. If there're #       untracked files, then a '%' will be shown next to the branch name. # #       If you would like to see the difference between HEAD and its #       upstream, set GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM=\"auto\".  A \"<\" indicates #       you are behind, \">\" indicates you are ahead, and \"<>\" #       indicates you have diverged.  You can further control #       behaviour by setting GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM to a space-separated #       list of values: #           verbose       show number of commits ahead/behind (+/-) upstream #           legacy        don't use the '--count' option available in recent #                         versions of git-rev-list #           git           always compare HEAD to @{upstream} #           svn           always compare HEAD to your SVN upstream #       By default, __git_ps1 will compare HEAD to your SVN upstream #       if it can find one, or @{upstream} otherwise.  Once you have #       set GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM, you can override it on a #       per-repository basis by setting the bash.showUpstream config #       variable. # # # To submit patches: # #    *) Read Documentation/SubmittingPatches #    *) Send all patches to the current maintainer: # #       \"Shawn O.
